  <h2> This is a website remodel I did as part of a team for Les Femmes de Substance, a pre-professional organization for women of color that encourages others to pursue leadership roles, develop their professional skills, and foster a sense of community. The website should be informative for the potential members and communicate any future events to the public. Some of their key goals are promoting leadership and unity, uplift other women, and create unity to combat the issues facing women of color.</h2>

Client also wants to attract prospective members and increase event involvement. Client would like to make the website more interactive.</h3>

Our personas were students currently at Cornell  </h3>

Some ideas to meet client needs include strong club branding through colors and images of club events to illustrate the idea that they are a professional organization yet personable to anyone who wants to learn more about the Les Femmes and include a President's page and information so that club appears more accessible and friendly
      We first tested these ideas before implementing them with persona walkthroughs </h3>
